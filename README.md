# futabaChanReader

This is a personal project I made to help view and archive futaba channel threads

#TODO
1. Fully finish the implementation in rich
2. Render images inside the terminal
  This may be difficult to do since rich does not support images inside a table, I will look for a workaround
3. Improve the archive function

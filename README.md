# futabaChanReader

This is a personal project I made to help view and archive futaba channel threads

# About
This is a command line reader for the site <a href="https://www.2chan.net">futaba channel</a>. I started this project when I needed to archive posts on the site for a research project I was working on. This uses the library <a href=https://pypi.org/project/waybackpy/>waybackpy</a> to archive threads and save the links to a local file. Hopefully you will find this program a comfortable way to casually browse the site as well. 

# TODO
1. Fully finish the implementation in rich\
&nbsp; add colors, formating, etc
2. Render images inside the terminal\
&nbsp; This may be difficult to do since rich does not support images inside a table, I will look for a workaround
3. Improve the archive function\
&nbsp; redo archive ui, archive multiple threads at once
